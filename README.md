## Configuration

### Payment Integration

This project uses **Instamojo** for payment processing. You'll need to set up an Instamojo account and use the API key and authentication token for integration.

1. Add the following keys to your `settings.py`:

   ```python
   INSTAMOJO_API_KEY = 'your-instamojo-api-key'
   INSTAMOJO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your-instamojo-auth-token'
   ```

2. The payment will be handled through the `process_payment` view.

### Admin Panel

You can manage brands, models, spare parts, and orders via the Django admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`. Use the superuser credentials created during installation.

---

## Usage

1. **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out. Only logged-in users can add items to the cart.
2. **Browse Brands and Models**: Users can browse spare parts based on the brand and model of their vehicle.
3. **Add to Cart**: Users can add items to their shopping cart and view the total price.
4. **Search**: Users can search for spare parts by name using the search bar.
5. **Checkout and Payment**: Users can proceed to checkout, where the total amount is displayed, and make payments using Instamojo.
